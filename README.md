Todo-Backend in Sinatra
====================

This is a simple implementation of the [Todo-Backend API spec](https://github.com/moredip/todo-backend).

It does not persist todos anywhere; they are just stored in a ruby Hash.

It is running live at [http://todo-backend-sinatra.herokuapp.com/todos](http://todo-backend-sinatra.herokuapp.com/todos).
